# UWFintech_Challenge_13

## Project Description
In this challenge I create a deep neural network model to try to predict whether an start up will be successful based on a number of features. The project includes preprocessing the data (encoding and scaling), using the model-fit-predict pattern to evaluate the classification model, and then optimizing the neural network by adjusting node and layer options.
